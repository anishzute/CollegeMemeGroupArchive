If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for Electrical Engineering even though it's technically Electrical and Computer Engineering. I take the hardest college courses on the planet in order to attain the BSEE degree and stand out from my lesser peers who do CS. Even though my peers in CS think CS is harder  they have no idea the struggle we go through. EE classes are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom than normal  business  premed  or even CS level classes. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in a EE environment so obviously  I've taken several EE classes. In fact  I take a lot of EE classes. I'm currently taking 5 EE classes this semester. EE classes involve exams that test your knowledge of the course and beyond in order to prove you deserve a BSEE degree. An A is the highest score  but usually a C or D would curve to an A or B which would translate to satisfactory understanding of the basic topics of a course. I have taken many EE past exams and have scored solid C's and D's on almost all of them. EE exams are very hard but I am very good at taking them. You have to be very smart in order to get a C or D before the curve. I've gotten quite a few B's and C's. The recruiting and internship components of EE simulate a better life experience better than other mundane majors can. The EE degree is a great way to get ahead in life while you're still in college  and it can help with getting internships at National Instruments  Amazon  Apple  Dell  or Microsoft because you can prove to the college that you're smart enough to already be taking the hardest major  also known as Electrical Engineering  shorthand as EE (Double E).,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Recently  a group of UT undergrads created a fundraising campaign named Fuel Our Heroes Austin (Facebook Page: Fuel Our Heroes Austin) that has partnered with The University of Texas’ Dell Medical School’s Emergency Response Fund for COVID-19 Relief **(a tax deductible donation fund)** to provide philanthropic support. These donations will allow Dell Medical to secure additional resources that are needed during this unprecedented time.  As members of the UT and Austin Community  it’s now our turn to give back to the University that has given us so much. To do this  I **challenge** everyone in this FB group to donate just $5 to the fund. With ~45 000 people in this group  $5 a person comes out to **$225 000**.  To help start even more growth  Fuel Our Heroes Austin has started an Instagram challenge called “See a Texas Memory  Send a Texas Memory.” Rules are as follows: Donate $5 to the campaign  post your favorite UT memory  and tag 5 friends and challenge them to do the same. Make sure to also tag and follow [@fuelourheroesATX](https://www.instagram.com/fuelourheroesatx/) on insta.  “What Starts Here Changes the World.” Here is our opportunity to do just that  starting with our own community. Let’s help take care of our healthcare professionals so we can get back to making memories on the Forty Acres.

The humour is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of postmodern politics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rohit's nihilistic outlook  which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes  to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Xavier & Rohit truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate  for instance  the humour in Rohit's existential catchphrase "What Starts Here?" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marshall Kistner's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes  by the way  i DO have a RotMan tattoo. And no  you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for Texas Academy of Math and Science. I enrolled in highly advanced college classes at the University of North Texas as a high school student in order to earn 60+ hrs of college credit and become a Junior or even Senior by credit upon entering college. TAMS classes are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom than normal  honors  or even AP level  classes. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in the TAMS environment  and I've taken several TAMS classes. In fact  I took 72 hours of TAMS classes over the course of 2 short years. TAMS classes involve actual college curriculum that tests your knowledge of the course at the level of a UNT college student. The 8am Biology classes  Bruce Cafeteria fine dining  and let's not forget the great Dr. Eric Gruver seminar sessions taken at TAMS prepare you for the real college experience better than mundane high school curriculums can. The regular UNT students highly admire the TAMS students for their incredible intellect and athletic ability- if you doubt this  just look up "TAMS kids" or "TAMS students" on twitter! Attending the Texas Academy of Math and Science is a great way to get ahead in college possibly even graduating a year or two early  and it can help with college admissions because you can prove to the college that you're smart enough to already be taking early college classes  also known as the Texas Academy of Math and Science  abbreviated as TAMS.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for Computer Science. I take the hardest college courses on the planet in order to attain the BS CS degree and stand out from my lesser peers who do EE. CS classes are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom than normal  business  premed  or even EE level  classes. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in a CS environment  and I've taken several CS classes. In fact  I take a lot of CS classes. CS classes involve exams that test your knowledge of the course in order to prove you deserve a BS CS degree. An A is the highest score  but usually a B or C would curve to an A or B which would translate to satisfactory understanding of the german topics of a course. I have taken many CS past exams and have scored solid C's and B's on almost all of them. CS exams are very hard but I am very good at taking them. You have to be very smart in order to get a B or C before the curve. I've gotten quite a few B's and C's. The recruiting and internship components of CS simulate a better life experience better than other mundane majors can. The CS degree is a great way to get ahead in life while you're still in college  and it can help with getting internships at Google  Facebook  Apple  Amazon  or Microsoft because you can prove to the college that you're smart enough to already be taking the hardest major  also known as Computer Science  abbreviated as CS.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

To amuse himself he took a great breath and sang out  "Internship! Internship! I’ve got an internship!"  His friends came thru to hype the boy up. But when they hopped into the chat  they found no internship. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.  "Don't cry 'internship'  engineering boy " said the friends  "when there's no internship!" They went grumbling back out of the chat.  Later  the boy sang out again  "Internship! Internship! I’ve got an internship!" To his naughty delight  he watched his friends run up the hill to hype him up for his internship.  When the friends saw no internship they sternly said  "Save your excited song for when there is really a job! Don't cry 'internship' when there is NO internship!"  But the boy just grinned and watched them go grumbling out of the chat once more.  Later  he got a REAL internship. Ecstatic  he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could  "Internship! Internship!"  But his friends thought he was trying to fool them again  and so they didn't come thru.  The next morning  everyone wondered why the engineering boy hadn't been in touch for a minute. They went up to find the boy in class the next day. They found him weeping.  "I really got an internship! I have plans for next summer! I cried out  "Internship!" Why didn't you come hype me up?”  A senior tried to comfort the boy as they sat down.  "We'll celebrate your internship tonight ” he said  putting his arm around the youth  "Nobody believes a liar...even when he is telling the truth!”,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Are longhorns in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies cattle  I am telling you  specifically  in science  no one calls longhorns cows. If you want to be "specific" like you said  then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "cow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Bos taurus  which includes things from herefords to banteng to holsteins.  So your reasoning for calling a longhorn a cow is because random people "call the horned ones cattle?” Let's get rhinos and lizards in there  then  too.  Also  calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other  that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A longhorn is a longhorn and a member of the cattle family. But that's not what you said. You said a longhorn is a cow  which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the cow family cows  which means you'd call yaks  selembu  and other cattle cows  too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong  you know?,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Milquetoast… Sad! How can you have a healthy McCombs snek  Computer science and/or Cockrell B.O.-reduction community when you've done nothing to address your unfair submissions process? When the admins still choose to sit on ur hands when addressing material inequity? When the mods still stand behind a bureaucratic facade only admitting memes from the most privileged of the UT student body? Most of y'all preapproved submitters are liberal shits with large vocabularies and no grasp on liberatory humor. To me  meme page rules are just neoliberal response to problems that require structural change. What's talking gonna get me when I'm hungry and eating ass at Jendy’s isn’t enough? Free Gregory Fenves and Tom Herman memes  but what if I got a really niche meme the mods don’t understand? There's no solidarity and no change in the status quo. Just give everyone preapproved submissions! It doesn't matter who's in charge if the meme needs of the marginalized haven't been met. This is like Memeing 101  y'all.

Bullying and corporal punishment   Has anyone ever experienced bullying and corporal punishment?  One fellow Longhorn just told me “people who are humble  respectful  and show humility generally earn more repect from other members of their fields.”  No  in sociology  this is “ideal culture” that people embrace. In reality  people practice “real culture.” When I was a 5-10 year old boy  I was innocent  good-natured  and unharmful. Because my grandfatherm  mom  and  aunt had to go working  I had to wander around my neighborhood.  Unfortunately  one old man who hated my grandparents because they used to be richer than him incited other kids to bully me. He himself threw a stone at my head causing a wound whose scar still remains on my forehead. I was too small and lonely  so I could do nothing.  Later  when I went to school  some of my classmate like teasing and bullying me. When I was in 4-5th grades  I could not stand anymore. I learned how to defend myself. I was a small kid  so I could do nothing but throwing stones at them to defend myself. I acted as though I had been a “porcupine” so that they did not dare to bully me. However  when I fight back  they reported to teachers  and administrators that I started the fight first. As a result  the administrators forced to stand by the flagpole in an attemp to humiliate me in front of all students in my school. They even lowered my rank and banned me from a fieldtrip that was award for outstanding students. Despite those punishments and affrons  I was not afraid.  When I was 6th grader in middle schools  I had some teachers who abused corporal punishments on students. My main teacher was a old woman who was from North Vietnam. When I and some of my classmates could not pay monthly tuition on time  the administrator called her to come the office. When she came back to class  she ordered us to go in the front of class. She beat us with her large wooden yardstick. It was really hurt. My teacher did not care her student  the only thing she cared was money.  Beside  one boy who was on the left to me thought I was from another district  so he kept teasing and bullying me. However  I was no longer an idle kid who was easily bullied. Whenever he hit me  I fought back. Then  my teacher tried to punish me and protect him because he was vice principal’s son. Right then  I told 3 of them that if they wanted to punish me  did not hesitate to do.  In the end of 6th grade  I was not dropped out of my middle school  and I never went to school until I got my GED and went to San Antonio College almost 12 years later. During the time  I learned to educate myself  and I became an autodidact who believed and depended nobody but me. In other words  I became my own teacher.   Therefore  people could not apply what they learned from their schools to me. Sometimes  you will become vulnerable victims if you are to innocent and good-hearted.  Hardships and obstacles will make you strong. Your mocking  hatred  and personal attacks toward me just make me stronger and better.   P/s: If you used to think that you had bad professors at UT  you were still fortunate not to have teachers like mine. Above all  you were all more fortunate than I was because you had a chance to go through middle and high schools. I didn’t have that chance  and I lost most of my childhood friends.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am  sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece  and who walks in but Matthew himself. I was nervous as shit  and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited  but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying  and I’m trying to quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother Matthew  but she wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Matthew put down his phone  picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. Chill guy  really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I did not see Matthew’s teats nor did anyone else in the hair salon. I’m extremely ashamed to have had so many fellow peers asking for the full story and having to digress. Cries of “not OC” and “this was on reddit” echoed for weeks  as I grew increasingly paranoid. Fortunately  my now 4 month old niece did happen to see Matthew’s nips as she was being breast fed  so I felt it was my responsibility to uncover the stone cold facts. What I got from the conversation with her was largely nonsense and toddler blabber  but I can now confirm  without question  Matthew’s areolas:     Quantity: 2 (pair)    Radius: 1.86 in.    Height of teat: 0.34 in.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

In the series (at the time  this was only one game) of football game(s) that decided the national champion that started the year after the second of these two winners won was the 2006 Rose Bowl  the Texas Longhorns won the national championship. Now that OU has had consecutive Heisman winners in 2017 and 2018 (Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray)  whatever series of football games that starts in 2019 that determines a national champion has to also be won by Texas. The College Football Playoff Semi-Finals happen are happening on December 29  2018  so the champion decided by destiny from the consecutive Heisman winner theory does not apply for this season. This means we will win the national championship next year for the 2019 season. This is indisputable. Patterns exist for a reason. I will speak this into existence.

The events were as follows-  In an amazing game  the horns win the big 12 championship against Oklahoma. After the 10 seconds of fireworks  the whole crowd falls silent. The players and coaches leave the field  except one. Breckyn Hager walks to the middle of the field and a hush comes over the crowd. The young prophet reaches downward and pulls a pair of shears from his left sock  shears that had apparently been in there all game long. Young Prophet looks to his left and sees governor Abbott wheeling himself onto the field. The Young prophet kneels as the governor approaches him. Abbott takes the shears  and in a stunning display snips the sacred locks of the young prophet.

He wouldn’t let me talk for the first bit  just droning on and on about how global and successful his organization is and how its alumni are recognized worldwide.  I eventually asked what the organization was about and he said “research and education”. After digging further he said excitedly that most UT Austin students can get in and not to worry about it. I asked how prestigious the institution could really be if any idiot can get in and again  like the slimeball he is  he deflected my question.  Since I had time to kill I let him continue his Ponzi scheme. He ended up saying that it only costs $11k a year to join. I nearly slapped him. $11k to join a useless organization that any idiot who can wipe his ass can get into??? Anything they could offer would be literally worthless and I feel sorry for anybody who fell for this ruse.

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for Aerospace Engineering. I took the least time picking my major because I just picked what was first alphabetically. I take college courses in order to attain the BS ASE degree and maybe stand out from my peers whose majors I don't know anything about because I don't talk to anyone. ASE classes are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom than normal  business  premed  or even ME level  classes. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in a ASE environment  and that environment is not always the actual aerospace building because I have had no aerospace classes in WRW. In fact  I haven't even taken a lot of Aerospace Engineering classes  and this is my fourth semester. Aerospace Engineering involves exams that test on like air and shit or something in order to prove you deserve a BS ASE degree. An A is the highest score  but usually a D or F would be equivalent to an A or B which would translate to satisfactory understanding of the germane topics of a course. I haven't taken many ASE past exams that I shouldn't talk about so I don't get probation like Hau Pham and have not scored solid anything on the exams I haven't taken. ASE exams are very hard but I am mediocre at taking them. You have to be very smart in order to get a D or F before the curve. I've gotten quite literally no D's and F's. The prospects of going to the Cockrell School of Engineering for a graduate degree or working in the defense industry to kill innocent civilians simulate a better life experience better than other majors can. The ASE degree is a great way to do stuff I don't know yet because I am still clueless about my major  and it probably won't help with getting a job at Boeing or Lockheed Martin because I won't be able to prove to the company that I'm smart enough to stay in the hardest major  also known as Aerospace Engineering  abbreviated as ASE.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I can't be the only one with this sentiment.  Look  I am all for wearing whatever clothes make you feel most comfortable but it seems more and more like standards have totally gone out of style.  We  including your professors  can see your buttcheeks falling out of your shorts. Why do some of you wake up in the morning and decide to wear the tiniest shorts possible?  UT campus is rife with students walking around sporting horrendous ensembles such as t-shirts and basketball shorts and flip flops  or tiny shorts and tank tops and flip flops--but most pervasively and perhaps the most tasteless one of them all (second only to the ass hanging out of your shorts look)--oversized t-shirts paired with what I presume there to be shorts underneath.  Now  I understand that this is a widespread phenomenon occurring all over the United States today  not just something happening on campus.  But I want to hear your opinion. Is it mainly that the general population is completely lacking in self-awareness  or have we collectively adopted such a 'non-judgemental' ideology that proclaims any judgement of one's appearance is insensitive or intolerant  and therefore it's impressed upon people that they can wear whatever ridiculous clothing they want and it's totally acceptable?  I caution you all to be mindful of how you present yourselves to others in an academic and professional setting.  Take pride and care in your appearance. Your body is a temple to be adorned with taste and elegance.  Just something to consider.",UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I am so in love with one of the girls in group. She doesn't normally post at this time so I am hoping this will slip under the radar and she won't see it. I mean I don't even know her bit everything about her seems awesome. She has a great sense of humour and posts alot of relatable shit.  Obviously looks are a part of it. She's not just pretty tho she's beautiful. Now I am not really an attractive person myself but I've been to her profile page alot and I just feel like we would click if we ever met judging by the posts she makes and the friends she seems to have.  I honestly think we are super compatible but see cause I found her in this meme group how do I tell her without coming off as being weird? My profile is on private so if she did happen to look at mine she wouldn't have a clue what I am like and I could just be another creep out there. I'm thinking about sending a private message or maybe send her some memes as a talking point. I also thought about just going fuck it and adding her as a friend but I don't know if she will remember I am from this group. Thoughts?,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I actually went and got help working on my application for study abroad. As you can tell  I'm still here. They even send an email to your teacher telling them that you visited. That way multiple people can laugh at how bad your essay on the Canterbury Tales is. You may also notice the computers available for students  you can log into them with your UT ID. There you can access the largest online catalog in the state of Texas. Alternatively  you can just watch anime or Korean soap operas between classes. Printing is not free  but you can pay for it with Bevo Bucks or by putting money on your printing account  but no one knows how to do that. This library is actually open 24 hours every day during finals week. You'll actually find students camping out here haha. But seriously  avoid the top floors past midnight.

They think I got in because of my scholarly records  but no the key is the interview.  As I sat in the Liberal Arts Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application  the Dean asks me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy  placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years  I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin  play four different instruments  I skipped grades 4 through 6  and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Bernie Sanders campaign  and New York Times." Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :),UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

The curriculum is extremely interdisciplinary  and without a solid grasp of theory of knowledge most of our lectures will go over a typical Longhorn's head. There's also the program's nihilistic outlook  a direct result of prospective employers not understanding mental superiority. Our personal philosophy draws heavily from David Foster Wallace's "Infinite Jest " for instance. The Plan 2'ers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these courses  to realize that they're not just about the love of learning- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Plan II majors truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate  for instance  the humour in George W. Bush's rejection from the program  which itself is a validation of Plan II's selectiveness compared to the Ivy Leagues. I'm smirking right now just imagining you addlepated simpletons scratching your heads in confusion as Professor Gleeson's genius unfolds itself in a Plan II physics lecture. What fools... how I pity you. 😂 And yes by the way  I DO have a Plan II tattoo. And no  you cannot see it. It's for my grad school admissions counselor's eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Hear me out  fellas:  1. AMP is spelled the same way as amp  short for the unit ampere  a measure of electric current. This further ties the name of the building back to physics  a subject taught inside the building.  2. AMP can be pronounced with one syllable. PMA can at best be shortened to two  but only if you say “pima” or “puma.” OK  the latter might be kind of cool  but it’s easier to just say “amp.” Better to save your breath to cry about your physics midterms.  3. AMP is in alphabetical order. As such  it does not meaningfully reinforce any academic hierarchies as to the relative importance of astronomy  math or physics  at least not in the way PMA might. Only incidentally  if at all.  4. AMP offers ample opportunity for name-based puns about class. “I’m so AMPed to go to lecture today.” “The dropped midterm really AMPlified my chances of passing that course.” And so on. Can you do the same for PMA? Not really. “PMA pants ” I guess.  5. AMP evokes a cooler vibe overall  bringing to mind guitar amplifiers and shit  I dunno. Does that accurately reflect the STEM major experience? Probably not  but a little positive marketing never hurt anyone.  6. Sure  the library in RLM is already the Physics  Math and Astronomy library. But it’s 2018: Books and reading are for liberal arts and fine arts majors (but probably just liberal arts majors in a few years — save the FAL  y’all). And tradition? Leave that to the College Station cult.  7. The namesake of RLM  Robert Lee Moore  was  besides being a racist  a mathematician. Although AMP still includes mathematics in its acronym  it gives it less of an emphasis than PMA does in terms of syllabic stress on the letter M  which would probably piss Mr. Moore off if he were still alive. You can’t be against that.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I thought not. It's not a story the Bevo bois would tell you. It's a UT legend. Darth UT Student was a Dark Lord of the Sith  so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to pass his final exams... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from failing their classes. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his GPA  which eventually  of course  he did. Unfortunately  he taught his apprentice everything he knew  then his apprentice made him procrastinate studying. Ironic  he could save others from failing their finals  but not himself.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Last year  I got a call from a UT number claiming that they were Fenves and I failed to perperly file a student tuition payment form. They knew so much about me. Pretty sure they got a bunch of info from the UT Student register   They said I owed $2000 in back tuition payments. They said the cops were coming to get me. It was so scary and I got $2000 scammed out of me. They keep you on the phone and make it very urgent. It sounds like it would be easy to tell the difference but they even had a blocked number calling me on the phone and the woman said it was the police trying to find me and to stay on the line with her.   I'm smart but these people are masters. It says I was kicked out of all of my classes  but that's probably a ruse by them. If you get one of these calls  hang up. Report the number to the meme page.

I was eating an outside lunch at this nice little restaurant and he was sitting eating some fucking salad. Salad. Typical fucking Sooner. He was there with his stupid Sooner wife who of course was eating a fucking salad too.  Jesus Christ I hate Sooners so much.  I could tell he thought he was part of the best fans in college football. He didn't say anything but the way that stupid prick was chewing. Jesus Christ. He had a fucking OU t-shirt on. I bet you he bought it at the team store like a fucking schmuck. He and the fucking stupid cashier probably had this big self-satisfactory exchange. "I'd like to buy this best t-shirt in college football with the best money in college football please". I couldn't fucking believe this asshole. He just kept going at this fucking salad like he's king of the world.  I just tried to ignore that attention seeking asshat but he just kept at it. Every time I looked away he'd conveniently grab for his water or some fucking passive aggressive bullshit so that it would draw my eyes to him. LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME BEST FAN IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL RIGHT HERE. Jesus.  You should have seen his wife. What a bitch. The waitress came by to ask them how their food was and she relayed how fucking satisfied she was in the most smug way possible. This fucking fake-politeness Sooners put on is ridiculous.  Next thing I know that guy pulls out his phone and starts texting. Are you fucking shitting me? I bet he just had to text his stupid friend all about his fucking salad was almost as good as being in Norman.  I couldn't fucking take it. l told that fucking idiot what a smug fucking asswipe he was. He was like 'dude what are you talking about' like he didn't fucking know what a prick he was. l fucking tackled him right there.  Staff called the cops on me as if l did anything wrong.

His hair style is extremely complicated  and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the bleached-blond spikes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Guy Fieri's off the hook outlook  which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from The Festival of Funk  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these hip little joints  to realize that they're not just effective- they can take you right to Flavortown. As a consequence people who dislike Guy Fieri truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate  for instance  the hot frisbee of fun in Guy's existencial catchphrase "bomb dot com tasty " which itself is a cryptic reference to Emril Lagasse's "Bam!" I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Guy Fieri genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way  I DO have a Diners  Drive-ins  and Dives tattoo. And no  you cannot see it.

I commute on the 801 daily so I've had a lot of experience on the bus  and I've always taken public transit when I've traveled. You can easily tell who on the bus is a UT student... They're college aged with backpacks of some sort  and always get off at the UT stops. A prime example of their rudeness happened to me today. I didn't have time to eat before commuting home so I opened a can of beans to eat on the bus and these students (looked to be freshmen) started hooting & hollering at me  pointing and shouting "this bitch eating beans!" over and over.

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for a small handful of UT Longmemes members. I scroll through the Facebook feed in order to find a relatable meme to tag my other fellow Coogs. UT memes are very difficult  involving a lot of inside jokes that students outside the campus may not comprehend. Only very intelligent students are able to recognize what a “Bevo” is  and I can relate. In fact  I take a lot of pride in knowing the lingo of UT Longmemes. Being a UH student within the UT Longmemes page is a great way to pass time in the MD Anderson Library  and it can help with getting Facebook notifications from UT students because you can prove to the meme page that you're smart enough to semi-relate as a student at a different campus  known as The University of Houston  abbreviated as UH.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

That being said  are we as humans  observers of one reality when said particles are observed or are we in a constant state of limbo between different likelihoods in the probability space of multiple parallel universes. For the sake of the argument  let's omit the assumption that the universe  past present and future is deterministic meaning that there are infinitely many universes to jump between when we make everyday choices. And for simplicity let's imagine this as a branching tree where each end of the branches make up the probability space. Your thoughts physics majors?

If you’re not familiar with the term  it stands for premedical student  a student who wants to go to medical school. I take a lot of science classes that I don’t enjoy  but it’s okay because I’ll be in medical school soon  where I’ll be taking even more science classes. I love to complain about my 3.98 GPA to anyone who will listen  even though I know it’s a great GPA and no one wants to give me the validation I crave. I also complain throughout the semester about how I can’t understand any of what’s going on in the class and I’m probably going to fail  but I still somehow always end up with an A. I enjoy using Snapchat only to capture scenes of me studying at 3 AM because appearances are very important to me. I took a lot of AP classes in high school to prepare me for my rigorous premed experience  but I didn’t claim any of my credits because I wanted to take the classes again to prove to medical schools that I’m capable. I praise all of my premed friends on their achievements even though I’m secretly having a breakdown because their achievements are my failures. Overall  being premed is only for the very intelligent and hardworking because it becomes your entire life and you have to be prepared to give up everything else  including a normal sleep schedule. I’m very proud to be a premed student  which stands for premedical undergraduate student  abbreviated premed.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

He has constantly destroyed UT's speedway  caused many noise complaints about university budget abuse  and boosted UT's tuition rate far too many times sending students into a spiral of depression. While he only wants to be UT's president  he is actually driving students away by harassing them during study sessions for finals in the PCL and annoying them with his weird car-karaoke video.   If anything Fenves is actually bullying UT students. If this is a college  how can it promote such a violent message that its okay to hurt people around you if you are just trying to be friendly?   Some of you might have suggested Fenves to leave  but as you all recall Longmemes actually ran out of content and basically had him come back. How can someone bully someone else  and then be too embedded in meme-discourse to ever leave?  Forget the inconsistencies in Fenves' qualifications for running a university  focus on the message that Fenves' actions show to our youth. Do we really want to instill the idea that its okay to hurt people in a misguided attempt to help them?

The theory behind it is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of distributed ledgers and blockchain  most discussions about bitcoin will go over a typical investor's head. There’s also bitcoin's highly favorable outlook  which is deftly woven into its recent rise to prominence- its popularity draws heavily from the McCombs' mob mentality  for instance. True business majors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of bitcoin  to realise that it’s not just a medium of exchange - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who make fun of bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate  for instance  how bitcoin is a portmanteau for "bit" and "coin” which itself is a cryptic reference to how progress hinges upon the marriage between technology and traditional economics. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as they attempt to read the latest masterpiece about bitcoin on the Wall Street Journal. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes  by the way  i DO have a bitcoin tattoo. And no  you cannot see it.

If you're not familiar with the term  it’s because the art building is in the furthest farthest reaches of campus  the nearest buildings are the coffee shop from which we get our fuel for the day  the DKR stadium  and the brand new EER. Both of which loom over our danky  falling-apart little building every day  reminding us that UT will never give us even the scraps it gives the STEM majors or UT football. We take the most intellectually  physically  and emotionally draining classes to get our grubby  calloused hands on that Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Even though my peers think all of us “art kids” get to go through college just drawing naked people and getting h*gh at co-ops  they have no idea the struggle we go through. Studio art classes are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom to make up for the fucking around we do IN the 3 hour  twice a week classes we have (which are either 8-11a  or 2-5p). Only very intelligent people can take a single concept  do DEEP research on it  abstract and develop it for anywhere from two weeks to a whole month  and then (sometimes right before it’s due) be able to pull an all nighter or two to materialize it  pouring your blood (@Xacto knives) sweat and tears into it only to come out with something that at first glance looks like it was made by a toddler. Come critique day  it’s not uncommon for the whole classroom to pick you and your hard work apart for up to 45 minutes  pointing out technical and conceptual flaws that you thought you had worked out. Many students cry during  before  or after critiques  mostly because of the aforementioned all nighters we pull sometimes multiple nights in a row. We’re running on nothing but espresso and adrenaline by the time critiques come around. And there’s either the kids who pulled all nighters like you or those who have their lives together and look extremely put together  making you and your dark circles and puffy eyes feel even more bad than you did already. The worst part is  if everyone just praises you and your work and doesn’t ask any questions  if you don’t challenge or move or confuse anyone  then you’ve failed as an artist. Not only that but often we have to travel so far (sometimes in the cold and rain  or worse: on a UT shuttle) with a project in our hands  praying it doesn’t get dropped or you don’t get bumped into and all your hard work gets ruined. There’s a reason we are one of the smallest schools on campus. Your GPA in high school means absolutely nothing if you don’t have a good portfolio  otherwise you don’t get in. Even when you do get in you’re told it’s time to start competing with the big boys  just because you’re a student doesn’t mean you can’t do anything any other artist can do. Being a Studio Art Major is only for the strong  the dedicated  the painfully romantic  the ones willing to spend four or more years for a degree that you dare not utter around adults  as you will only be asked “what are you gonna do with THAT”. If you want to go to grad school  you’re definitely gonna get rejected if you apply immediately after college. One of my teachers applied to Yale six (6!) times before he finally got in. Last semester  my world renowned photo professor told us all very bluntly and plainly  “none of you are even close to being ready for grad school.” In between undergrad and grad school  we all will have to give in to our biggest enemy  commercial “art”  one way or another  just to make ends meet. This is no major to be underestimated. Being a studio art major is a way of life  there aren’t any tests or facts to learn. There is only one fact in this life: you will definitely fail. Multiple times. It is the only way you will learn.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

If you're not familiar with the term  that means I say I want to die over the smallest things. I take the hardest college classes on the planet but it doesn't matter because I don't have the energy to go to class  I get docked for skipping and it results in a vicious cycle of self-hatred and guilt over an arbitrary token of measurement of self-worth which means I skip more classes. Being depressed is very difficult  involving a lot more depression naps than the average undepressed person (zero(0)). Only very depressed students are able to assert their depressed dominance in an environment where everyone still engages in the suffering olympics like it's fucking high school. In fact  I'll have you know that I stay up all night playing shitty mobile games in order to distract myself from the anxiety that comes from impending deadlines and my inevitable failure of a future. I haven't ate  showered  or slept in three weeks  which is the minimum requirement for being "actually" depressed because I constantly compare my mental health with others and in turn invalidate my own depression. Isolation is a great way to get ahead in college because you can convince yourself that your friends all hate you and so you can finally focus on your coursewo- oh wait  nap time again because I remembered that I forgot to take my meds and it's 4am and I can't believe I'm still worried about how I tried to be friends with someone a week ago by telling someone to shut their whore mouth  they're smart and they weren't even talking about themselves  anyway I'm pretty sure I don't exist because I'm depressed  also known as "i'm not a fucking neurotypical  becky"  abbreviated as [fuck if i know i cant make fuckin memes].

If you don't know what that is  then your parents probably aren't Asian. I am part of an elite group of students who have been chosen to become the next generation of doctors. To have reached this point  I conquered the MCAT - the most difficult graduate entrance exam ever created. I annihilated every single one of my undergraduate classes to achieve a perfect 4.0 GPA. I had admission committees from multiple schools begging me to select their school as my top choice. Medical school classes are very difficult  you see - far surpassing that of any AP  IB  or undergraduate course. One is expected to think and analyze like a clinician to diagnose and treat illnesses. To say that it's akin to "drinking out of a fire hydrant" wouldn't be a lie. With multiple classes each semester  a single medical school midterm contains more information than a semester long undergraduate course.   So how does one survive  you may ask? With the national acceptance rate of 5%  only the best and brightest are admitted to medical school. I am one of them. In fact  I don't think medical school is even that difficult. I came 15 minutes late to my first lecture and I quickly realized that I was too smart for school. Why spend time in class when you can browse memes instead? With that said  you learn some amazing things in medical school. Whether it's holding a human brain in your hands or waking up at 5 AM to assist with an open heart surgery  medical school truly is a one of a kind experience. One that only I and a select few may experience.   Attending medical school is a great way to get ahead in life in general due to great salary  job stability  and high occupational prestige. Have I mentioned doctors are really smart? You should become one! Except you can't  because you aren't in medical school.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

If you're not familiar with the term  it means that I have been accepted to the University of Texas at Austin. I will attend the most prestigious school in Texas in order to stand out from my lesser peers at Texas A&M. UT is a very challenging school  involving a lot more work outside and inside the classroom than at TAMU. Only very intelligent students are able to be admitted to UT  and I’m a part of that elite crew. In fact  I have been accepted over thousands of other students destined for Texas A&M. Being accepted to the University of Texas at Austin implies that you are a very hard-working and successful high school student. I have passed many offers of acceptance from other Texas schools and received desperate phone calls from almost all of them. Getting into UT without being capped is very hard  but I am very good at getting in and not getting capped. You have to be very smart to achieve this kind of success. Studying at the University of Texas is a great way to get ahead in life  and it can help with finding success because you can prove to other people that you are smart enough to be a student at the University of Texas at Austin  abbreviated as a Longhorn.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for doctor of philosophy student. I take the hardest postsecondary curriculum in the planet in order to attain the Ph.D. and stand out from my lesser peers who do masters theses. Ph.D. experiments are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the lab than normal  honors  or even senior-level  labs. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in a Ph.D. environment  and I've done several Ph.D. experiments. In fact  I do a lot of Ph.D. experiments. The Ph.D. involves a qualifying exam that tests your knowledge of the field in order to prove you deserve the Ph.D. A 'pass' is the highest score  and usually a pass would translate to satisfactory understanding of the germane topics of a field. I have taken many qualifying exams and scored 'pass' on almost all of them. Grad classes are very hard but I am very good at taking them. You have to be very smart in order to get an A in a grad class. I've gotten quite a few A's. The qualifying exam and preliminary exam components of the Ph.D. simulate the experience of not joining the real world better than other mundane curriculums can. The Ph.D. is a great way to get ahead in while you're still too afraid to look for a job  and it can help with getting a job because you can prove to the hiring manager that you're smart enough to already be taking the hardest college curriculum  also known as the Doctor of Philosophy  abbreviated as Ph.D.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

If you’re not familiar with the term  that’s “Hahah no  I’m not dating anyone right now. I’m just focusing on my grades.” In high school  I decided to deviate from the norm and become gay to stand out from my lesser peers  the straights. Being gay is very difficult because it’s physically impossible for us to make mistakes since we’re instinctively perfect at everything we do. Only very strong-willed gays are able to thrive in the #mascformasc community on dating apps like Grindr  and I’ve been on Grindr for several years now. In fact  I’ve been on Jack’d  Scruff  Tinder  and Hornet for 4 years. Being gay actually tests your knowledge on gay culture and competence among other homosexuals. Knowing RuPaul’s Drag Race references  the choreography to Beyonce’s latest song  and let’s not forget stealing black culture and claiming it as our own. The regular straight guys highly admire gay people for their good looks and naturally fit bodies--if you doubt this  just look up literally any gay person on the internet. Joining the LGBT community is a great way to convert to homosexuality  possibly even converting to asexuality  and it can help with social acceptance because you can prove to everyone how perfect you are because you chose to be gay  also known as a homosexual  shortened to homo.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Because of that  I ended up finding myself at ACC (Austin Crying College) for 2 years. UT Austin classes are very difficult  involving a lot more crying outside the classroom than other universities. Only very emotional students are able to thrive in the UT environment  and I've taken several UT classes. In fact  I took like 10 hours of classes over the course of 1 short year. UT classes involve actual curriculum that tests your knowledge of the course at the level of an old Ivy League professor’s mind. The 8am exams  J2 swipes  and let's not forget the great ass-eating at Wendy’s.

I take literally the easiest way out in meme construction in order to attain my free likes by shameless spouting off bland copypasta instead of actually working on original content. I sometimes think of spending time and effort on memes but that would require me to actually possess an iota of originality and will to live both of which have been sapped away by Daddy Fenves. Meming like this is very easy  involving less work than personal hygiene  dating  or even eating ass. Only the brightest are able to piggyback on a trend like this and get away with it. I've taken several classes in the delicate art of beating a dead horse. In fact  sometimes after I navigate the Yellow Brick Road of Speedway  i personally go to the hills  find a horse  and shoot it just so i can get the sadistic pleasure of beating its dead body over and over again until there is no more horse left. Ordinarily a mere peasant wouldn't be able to replicate my success  but I had the foresight to start this trend around Valentines day where all the lonely single HORNSy teens gleefully treated my kitsch posts as an opportunity to participate in the biggest circlejerk in Austin history  more action than they've ever seen in their lifetime. With these posts I have singlehandedly manage to let every Cockrell kid get jerked off this Valentines day  an impressive achievement.  In the end after getting 26 likes for my utter lack of talent  I have decided to include my status as a LONGmemer on my resume.

UT Memes involves stealing content that push your knowledge of the best sources in order to prove you can repost first. I have posted many times and have gotten atleast 1 like on almost all of my memes  but that's okay because memes are about sharing joy  not creating original content. Making memes is very hard but I am very good at stealing them. You have to have a massive brain in order to get several likes. I've gotten quite a few facebook likes.

To be fair  you have to have a very high I.Q. to understand metamemes  but if you're smart and original enough you too can start making the funniest of memes  also known as metamemes  abbreviated meta.

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for Undergraduate Studies. I take the most time consuming college courses on the planet in order to attain the BS UGS degree and stand out from my lesser peers who has actual majors. UGS classes are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom than normal  business  premed  or even CS level  classes. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in a UGS environment  and I've taken several Undergraduate Studies classes. In fact  I take a lot of Undergraduate Studies classes. Undergraduate classes involve exams that test on participation and effort in order to prove you deserve a BS UGS degree. An A is the highest score  but usually a D or F would be equivalent to an A or B which would translate to satisfactory understanding of the germane topics of a course. I have taken many UGS past exams and have scored solid D's and F's on almost all of them. UGS exams are very hard but I am very good at taking them. You have to be very smart in order to get a D or F before the curve. I've gotten quite a few D's and F's. The prospects of going to the College of Liberal Arts for a graduate degree or working at a fast food chain simulate a better life experience better than other actual majors can. The UGS degree is a great way to remain in college while you're still in college  and it can help with getting a job at McDonald's or Chick-fil-A because you can prove to the company that you're smart enough to stay in the hardest major  also known as Undergraduate Studies  abbreviated as UGS.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for researching assistant. I research in the linguistics department while in college in order to attain college credit and stand out from my lesser peers. RAing while taking a full load is very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the classroom than just signing up for classes  or even taking  classes. Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in an RA environment  and I've RA’d for several laboratories (labs) and various professors (profs). In fact  I RA for a lot of labs. RAing for labs involves an interview with a professor that tests your knowledge of the field in order to prove you can research effectively and help on the research projects. Passing the interview with the highest score  and usually passing would translate to the professor acknowledging that you have a satisfactory understanding of the germane topics pertaining to the laboratory. I have been interviewed many times and passed almost all of them. Interviews are very hard but I am very good at passing them. You have to be very smart in order to pass an interview. I've passed quite a few. RAing labs is a great way to get ahead in college while you're still in college  and they can help with college courses because you can prove to the college that you're smart enough to already be RAing in labs  also known as conducting research as a research assistant in a research lab  abbreviated as RAing in a lab.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Only very intelligent students are able to thrive in a TA environment  and I've TA’d for several classes. In fact  I TA for a lot of classes.

If you're not familiar with the term  that stands for a warrior's dignity  pride  and unbreakable bond with their Pokemon companions. I fight the strongest Gym Leaders on the planet in order to become a Pokemon Master and stand out from my badgeless peers. Pokemon battles are very difficult  involving a lot more work outside the Pokemon Center than Bug Catchers  Youngster  Team Skull Grunts  or even other trainer classes. Only very intelligent Pokemon trainers are able to thrive in a Trainer environment  and I've fought several other trainers. In fact  I battle every trainer I make eye contact with. Gym battles involve fighting that test your knowledge of other Pokemon in order to prove you deserve a gym badge. An Earth Badge is the most elusive badge  but usually a Marsh Badge would cause all Pokemon up to Level 70 to obey you unconditionally which would translate to winning most fights against NPCs in the region. I have bred many Gible and have gotten penta-perfect IVs on almost all of them. You have to be very smart in order to get penta-perfect IVs before bottle caps. The breaking into random stranger's homes and picking items off the floor components of the Trainer experience simulate the lawless post-apocalyptic lifestyle better than other mundane careers can. The Pokemon Championship is a great way to get ahead in life while you're still 10 years old  and it can help with Ace Trainer positions because you can prove to the Gym that you're smart enough to already be EV training and playing the hardest game series  also known as Pokemon  the most beautiful sport  the most noble profession.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

My love life  my friend. The sun rises yonder  rising with hope  And my heart sinks with every harsh "nope"  The fear of rejection is no longer fear  Just simple acceptance of my status here. A lonely poor student  with no hope at hand  Trudging through college  alone and no plan.  He says "you're my life's light  the star of my life" Yet I know to me she'd be the whole damn night sky. So much love to give  all pent up inside  Yet every year I can give but just a sigh.  I sit at the Pickle  drawing equations  Frankly wasting time on facebook meme pages. And ponder what's wrong? Why can't I find love? Find someone who'll lift my poor heart up above?  And in my third integral interpretation  I found the cause for my poor situation!

I know many of my points have been blocked by a communication barrier. As you know  I came to America from Vietnam about 7 years ago  however  I didn't attend school for about 11-12 years. My knowledge from English is basically self-taught. As such  the points that I make may not come across as it should. I'm sorry for any miscommunication that may have come across. I am still adjusting to the culture and language of America.   Also  since I hadn't been to school for such a long time  I lost a sense of social connections. Back in elementary school  I was just like everyone else  but I've been isolated for a long time. The friends that i still have are from my elementary school in Vietnam many years ago. I am still have good connections to them  and I am chatting to them every day.  I am still adjusting to a new social environment.   I've never had anyone to depend on  so I practically raised myself. Leaving school after 6th grade  I had to educate myself to get in UT. I had to take care of myself and my family. My mother suffers from cervical cancer. One of my goals is to study and cure her cancer.  The reason why I act so confident and ambitious is because that's the only thing that keeps me going. I have to depend on myself instead of others. It may come off as arrogant  but that's not my intention. Due to miscommunication  I sound racist or homophobic  but I promise that I am not. I just want to help other people to seek happiness. My idea about Reconstruction Technology just mean to help homosexual people have their preferred biological bodies enabling them to have children with the ones they love.   In person  you can find that I'm not an offensive person.  I'm sorry.",UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person  but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said  “Oh  like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback  and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping  and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional  and was like “Sir  you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her  but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times  he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence ” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price  he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

It's pretty much my last semester here  and with all the money I've saved by not buying textbooks  I can finally afford a half-semesters worth of being in a broternity. Fair warning  I live by Ferris Beuler's words of wisdom in that  "life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in awhile  you could miss it." So like  is it cool if I don't rush anywhere? Can I just  yaknow  casually walk places instead? Oh  and as a bonus  I already have a fratty name  as I can just go by "Josh".   Thanks in advance for any assistance which you may give. I look forward to strictly platonic Honda Ruckus rides with my future family.

His humor is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of his jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Hau's nihilistic outlook  which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Breitbart  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate his vision for the Viet Empire  to realize that it's not just inspiring- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Hau Pham truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate  for instance  the terrifying threat in Hau's existential catchphrase "I will ask Trump and the Republican Party to step in " which itself is a cryptic reference to Faraday's On the Various Forces in Nature. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated libtards scratching their heads in confusion as Hau Pham's genius unfolds itself on their Facebook feed. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way  I DO have a past CH302 exam. And no  you cannot see it.

You should not take a knee to them. Someday in the future  after you surpass them  you should come back to UT. I think most of them will be happy because  only good professors produce good students.  Back in time when I was in elementary school  I told my teachers and administrators that I would surpass them in the future. Eventually  I could achieve my goal.  Next time  when all of you go for a protest like engineering students  you should write this message and speak it loudly:   Hey Mr. Fenves  Prof.X  Prof. Y  Prof. Z   Prof. you name  All of you can give us those fk hard midterms now  but we are sure that someday in the future we will do better than all of you.

After working on that  they get home and look on their phone at  memes. They see one that they think is absolutely hilarious  so  they decide to send it to their friend  expecting them to think  it's also hilarious and they can share a fun experience. Instead   the only respond  "omg me."    This happens again the next day. After spending all day almost  completely alone in class and in the virtual reality laboratory   they come home and look at memes. They see one they really like   and send it to their frien. They expect some kind of input on the  picture  but instead only receive  "same."  This continues for weeks. The main character is extremely lonely   their only human interaction being extremely rare conversation  with their professors. They hope their friends will be there for  them  but they only ever give generic responses. They start  becoming depressed  thinking no one really cares about them   thinking if people cared they could think of more than a few  cliched words. But they have an idea.  They look at all the people who responded with things like   "literally me " "same " "omg same  "totes me  "me " etc  and  invites those people to look at thier research in the laboratory.  Once they are all there  they are hooked up to the virtual  reality machines  and forced to experience all the memes that  they said they were like. Forever. The main character leaves  themalone in the laboratory indefinitely to live out the memes  until they die  because they were willing to let the main  character live out their life alone until they died only ever  receiving meaningless  thoughtless cliched phrases.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Someone tells you Speedway is just a road and they don’t know what you are talking about. You go outside and it’s just a normal road again. You try to tell people you remember there being a construction project called the “Speedway Mall Project ” but no one has ever heard of it. The craccly boi memes never even existed. You are convinced you have gone completely insane and go to talk a counselor (that you don’t have to pay for  further proof this is a fictional world)  and  as you explain your confidence that there was a yellow brick Speedway  UTPD offices come in an take you to a room where they attach electrodes to your head that wipe any memory of Speedway from your mind. Later  someone asks you if you figured out about the weird construction you were talking about  but now you are the one who doesn’t know. Greg Fenves is shown talking to scientists with Russian accents telling them the secrets of “Project Speedway” are safe  and accepts a large briefcase full of cash after the scientists thank him for his cooperation in “testing the limits of the human mind’s capacity of patience.” The scientists take a sip of their Dunkin’ Donuts coffee and leave.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Her purpose in The Last Jedi is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of character development most of her scenes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Finn's self-centered outlook  which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from his focus on survival after escaping the First Order. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes  to realize that they're not just pointless- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Last Jedi truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate  for instance  the humour in Luke's existencial catchphrase "Impressive... Every word in that sentence was wrong" which itself is a cryptic reference to the learnings of the true nature of the Force by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Rian Johnson's genius unfolds itself on the movie screens. What fools... how I pity them.  And yes by the way  I DO have a BB-8 tattoo. And no  you cannot see it.

Your friends will eventually think it's because Dr. Who is a show about time travel and that the joke is that they want to be a doctor in the future. Never confirm nor deny. Eventually  start slipping who into more and more words. Eventually start sleeping all day and being active at night. If people call you a night owl thank them way too enthusiastically. Eventually wear owl contacts and months after that cover yourself in feathers. A few weeks later have somebody break your neck so you die with your head facing backwards. Arrange to have your self stuffed and put in your will that you should be given to one if your pre-med friends. They will feel guilty and accept your trophy body.

Knowing that P Diddy is also a successful businessman  the University has now decided to rename the respective college to the “Combs School of Business”. At first  P Diddy was reluctant to accept this honor after the university found an infestation of boa constrictors in the building  which is very ironic because the students that study there are inherently snakes.

They are friends. Let's call them A and B. A wants to be more than friends with B  but B does not realize it. A is not sure how to communicate their feelings to B but tries their best anyway. B can tell that A is sending them signals but is not sure how to read them. B has low romantic self-confidence and does not trust that A likes them as more than a friend. So  B brushes off A's advances  much to A's dismay. The two spend some time apart. In that time B develops romantic feelings for A. Deciding that A's signals are romantic in nature after all  B plans to send the same signals back  in hopes to form a romantic relationship with A. However  in that time A has gotten closer to other people  mainly person C  whom B believes is more attractive than them. B sees that and feels that all hope is lost. B stops talking to A to rid themselves of their romantic feelings. A sees this as a rejection of their feelings and by consequence their friendship with B starts to dissolve. As time passes A and B no longer run into each other and cease contact.   What do you think either A or B could have done to save their relationship  or possibly even pursue a romantic one?,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I know it's fun and exciting to frequently change the name or our flagship meme page  but we need a steady and recognisable name if we are to compete with the likes of UC Berkeley  and "UT memes for top 6% teens" does just that.  Besides  calling this page "UT memes for top 5% teens" would allow us to boast of our self-awareness with a cheeky commentary on our admissions system.

I love Plan II  and shaming people for interdisciplinary pursuits is bullying. Being a decent human being (not worthy of receiving hatred) and reading Infinite Jest are not mutually exclusive. I  for instance  received a copy for Christmas my freshman year. I had not asked for it  nor did I know its reputation. My parents had seen that my peers had all gone to private schools or public schools in rich areas  and because we come from a marginally more socioeconomically diverse area and I didn’t have exposure to pretense  it was very important to them that I fit in  so they went ahead and bought me what they had heard was a book hip enough for Plan II. When I realized the implications  I questioned their purchase  but my mother reasoned with me that what Plan II offers is not the label (like McCombs) but value (plus it has opportunities to strengthen my grad school apps). I'm conscious of how lucky and blessed I am to have parents willing to spend $70 to keep me updated with the latest issue of the New Yorker. Yes  there might be some people out there who use Plan II for conspicuous consumption (and that is inconsiderate and a bad trait  but honestly they have the right to major in BHP as they see fit)  but I am also certain that there are other students like me for whom this major is merely functional — who only mention it before we’re asked and for whom this was just the best option after getting rejected from Stanford. So please don't put everybody in the same box. Don't condemn me and make me feel guilty for my major. I'm well aware I come from a more interdisciplinary background than most  but that is not something within my control and I always try not to isolate LAH kids  help when possible and not make fun of Cockrell. Fearing judgement and wanting to hide my lack of job prospects whenever I walk out of the house with my liberal arts degree is unnecessary stress.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I've been very confused. My sister  Sameen Faruqi  has vast experience with UT memes  but she refuses to help. I just won't get it  she says... so I come to you for help. I have many questions  but I'll start with a couple.  1. What is a boi? And why is he so "smol" and "angery"? 2. What does "reaccs only" mean? 3. Who is daddy fenves and is he really as freaky as they say? 4. Is Mahir Karim daddy fenves? Would make a lot of sense.

The fractal pattern is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of physical chemistry most of the flakes will go over a typical memer’s head. There’s also the weather’s thermodynamic outlook  which is deftly woven into its radar- its personal philosophy draws heavily from Herbert Callen literature  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these patterns  to realise that they’re not just unique arrangements of ice crystals- they say something deep about precipitation. As a consequence people who dislike snow truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate  for instance  the humour in snow’s existential catchphrase “The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures ” which itself is a cryptic reference to Wikipedia’s epic Snow. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Frosty the Snowman’s genius wit unfolds itself on their car windshields.

I told her how cool it was to meet her in person  but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything.  She said  “Oh  like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback  and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping  and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional  and was like “Ma'am  you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her  but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times  she stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence ” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price  she kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

The play calling is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the plays will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Tom Herman’s MENSA outlook  which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays  to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Tim Beck truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate  for instance  the genius in Tim’s play “Porter up the middle ” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tim Beck’s genius unfolds itself on the football field. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes  by the way  i DO have a Tim Beck tattoo. And no  you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

While conversing  they heard the sound of tires squealing followed by a loud crash. They quickly responded and observed that a vehicle had crashed through the front of the Poke Bowl Restaurant and came to rest in the bathroom. Officers observed that the vehicle was still occupied and the driver (a UT Student) was attempting to put the vehicle in reverse and leave the scene. Officers ordered the suspect to get out of the car but she persisted in her attempt to leave the scene. However  the structure of the restaurant had collapsed around the car preventing it from moving. The debris also prevented the doors from opening. One officer used his baton to break out a window to allow the driver to exit the vehicle. While the window was successfully opened  it proved to precarious to have the driver exit through it. Another officer  assisted by a security guard  at the risk of their own safety  moved debris from the passenger side of the vehicle and was able to safely extract the driver. Officers summoned EMS and the driver was found to have only minor injuries. Upon interacting with the driver  the officers quickly formed the belief that she may have been intoxicated. The driver argued with officers and demanded an immediate breathalyzer (it doesn’t work that way). The officers attempted to explain to the driver that APD would be responding as well since the crash occurred in their primary jurisdiction. The driver explained that she was UT affiliated and as a result would only interact with UTPD. The officers attempted to explain that they  in fact  were UTPD. Shortly thereafter  the driver attempted to snatch her ID from the officer’s hand. Given her aggressive behavior and the evidence that she was intoxicated  officers made the decision to take her into custody. When officers attempted to place the suspect into handcuffs  she violently pulled away and explained (and this is a direct quote) “I’m a UT Student! You can’t arrest me!” Officers asked the suspect if her intention was to fight the police to which she replied “yeah!” Officers were able to safely place her in handcuffs before escorting her to the police car – without a use of force. However  once inside the car  the suspect began to kick at the windows and doors of the vehicle. Officers restrained her in the back seat and transported her to Travis County Central Booking. Upon arrival  Deputies placed her into the restraint chair and wheeled her into isolation due to her violent behavior. Occurred on 11/6/17 at 2:22 am.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

You're probably thinking  "Wow what a dumb thing to say  Matthew McConaughey is Texas' favorite son " but is he really?  I charted Texas football wins and compared them to Matthew McConaughey's rise  and the results speak for themselves.  We start our journey back in 2008  which is both the beginning of the McConaissance and of the collapse of Texas football.  In 2008  "Tropic Thunder" is released. McConaughey played the minor role of Rick Peck  the agent. His part was small  but McConaughey’s ability to imbue Peck "with the faintest hint of sympathy as he struggled with betraying his best friend and owning a Gulf Stream V ultimately rewrote the ending of the picture  as Peck was originally killed off by the film’s villainous Laotian drug cartel. Instead  Stiller reshot an ending where Peck saves his friend and gets his Gulf Stream. It surely made moviegoers h-h-h-h-h-appy."  2008 was not only a turning point for McConaughey  but also for the Longhorns. Texas started the season ranked 11th  but moved up to 5th before the Red River Shootout against No. 1 Oklahoma. Texas would beat OU 45-35 and take the No. 1 spot in the Polls. Texas went on to win two more games against ranked teams  No. 11 Missouri and No. 7 Oklahoma State. Texas faced off against No. 6 Texas Tech in Lubbock and was up 33-32 with 8 seconds left when "CRABTREE PULLS FREE" happened. Texas lost and has not been ranked No. 1 since.  2009 was a great year for Texas football — they went undefeated and won in a miracle finish against Nebraska in the Big 12 championship game. McConaughey was not in any movies that year  but he decided to transform himself from the star of romantic comedies into a serious actor. I found this quote from him that he said three days before Texas faced Alabama in the national championship game:  "I got to feeling like  for a few years  I was doing something that I liked to do with romantic and action comedies. But believe me  I noticed there were other things that were not coming in. And if they were coming in  it was in an independent form with a much smaller paycheck  and nobody really wanting to get behind them ... But I knew I could say no to the things I'd been doing. In saying no to those things  I knew work was going to dry up for awhile ... Year and a half  still nothing. At two years  all of a sudden  in my opinion  I became a new good idea for some good directors."  Colt McCoy was knocked out of the game in the first quarter and Texas had no chance after that  falling to Alabama 37-21 and giving the Tide their first natty of the Saban era.  2010 was a disaster for the Longhorns  they went 5–7  the first losing season in Austin since 1997. McConaughey spent that year filming three of the movies that would redefine him  "Lincoln Lawyer " "Bernie " and "Killer Joe." These three films shattered all conceived opinions about what McConaughey could do as an actor and established him as a serious an talented actor. Quite a dichotomy from the Longhorns  who began the season ranked 5th  but would finish the season on a 5 game losing streak to power 5 teams.  2011 saw McConaughey win his first acting award since 2005 for his role in Bernie. 2011 would see the Longhorns finished the season 8–5 with a win over Cal in the Holiday bowl. However Texas went 4–5 in conference and once again finished the season unranked.  2012  Texas went 9–4  but still finished the season with 2 straight losses and ended the year unranked. 2012 would also be the last bowl win for Texas  a 31-27 comeback win over Oregon State in the Alamo bowl. Meanwhile McConaughey played the supporting role in "Magic Mike" next to Channing Tatum. This was the first film where McConaughey established himself as a possible Academy Award winner. A film critic wrote of his performance in "Magic Mike":  "A sleeper hit in 2012 for obvious reasons  Magic Mike attempted to explore the underbelly of seedy male erotica that’s supposedly based on star Channing Tatum’s real-life experiences. However  the true toe-tapping treat for audiences was McConaughey’s club owner and former dancer. Equal parts mentor and nefarious shade of the Ghost of Christmas Future  McConaughey acted as Bette Davis to Tatum’s Anne Baxter. As campy as it is gritty  McConaughey playing the older  grosser side of his rom-com bronze statue from only 10 years prior earned a fervent following that even petitioned for Oscar recognition from its most incredulous of devotees."  2013. This was the year Texas fired longtime coach Mack Brown. McConaughey also won his first Oscar. He received the award for best actor for his performance in "Dallas Buyers Club." 2013 also produced one of his most iconic scene. His rhythmic  thumping chant in "Wolf of Wall Street" became famous across the world and is a fixture of Texas home games in DKR. Texas fans think of it as a tribute to their favorite alum and a pump-up chant for the Horns  but what McConaughey is actually doing is sucking up all their players talent so he can use it as an actor. Since McConaughey won that Oscar  Texas has not won more than 6 games in a season.  2014 Texas fans were optimistic because of the hiring of Charlie Strong as HC. He was to breath new life into a stagnant program and bring Texas back into the national spotlight. This was not the case. Charlie Strong was fired last year after a 16-21 record  the worst winning percentage of a HC in Texas history. Some of the lowlights include: - Losing to Kansas for the first time since before WW2 - Back to Back losing seasons for the first time in 30 years - Never beating TCU - Only Texas Coach in history to never win a bowl game  At the same time  Matthew McConaughey has reached the pinnacle of his popularity. Some of his highlights include: -He received an Emmy nomination for his role in "True Detective." - Becoming the face of Lincoln and revived the brand.  He spoke to the Texas Longhorns in 2014 after a 41-7 asskicking by BYU. Rather than rallying the horns  he stole their energy and passion and redirected it into his career. His career tract from 2008–2014 has been dubbed the McConaissance by many. Thus  it is clear that McConaughey has stolen the power of the Texas Longhorns for himself.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

As far as I can tell this entire exchange is fostered out of the malice of someone who long since graduated from UT  but not before teaching new students to just hate on OU.

Just a thought  but maybe you can learn to actually enjoy the company of OU. When you visit their campus  bring cookies or something to help ease the tensions you may have with their campus.

The show panders to a fanbase of mentally-challenged pseudo-intellectuals who actually believe that the show is extremely deep and highly scientific in its depiction of convoluted sci-fi garbage and constant poop jokes. As with all other Adult Swim shows  it has the child appeal equivalent to that of anything airing on Disney XD  animation that isn't much above what high-school  first year art students could make in their personal deviantART doodlebooks  along with repetitive episodes which entail many sexual  mutated  gore-filled adventures that are too fucked up to air on any other basic cable channel. This piece is about a batshit-insane  drunken grandpa; named Rick  and his queer 14-year-old grandson; Morty and the retarded catastrophic abominations they create on their time-wasting journeys across the universe. There's currently 3 seasons of this shit; and counting. The fanbase is emotionally stunted  cuntilicious and beefcurtainy beyond all belief.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

They enter a small room  Paul Ryan sitting in wait. "How long has he been there?" mused Rex. "Nevermind  no time for that " he thought as he meandered over to his seat: a small chair with a yet smaller attached desk. On it a paper  "TILLERSON" in deep red bold faced letters at the top. He looked over at our president  his hair perched in a graceful swoosh over his forehead. Somehow knowing of Rex's nervous gaze  he turned his head and gave a confident wink and a smile. Rex turned away anxiously and felt his forehead. Wet. How long had he been sweating? No  Rex  focus. Paul Ryan cleared his throat and spoke  "You will have 1 minute to complete. There is only one question. You may begin in 3 seconds"  Wait  what?  "3"  Only one question? Five minutes?  "2"  How could they possibly fit an entire test in one question?  "1. You may begin."  Those practice tests  the countless tutoring sessions  all made moot by the single question staring him mockingly in the face  "Do you watch Rick and Morty?"  Rex felt the tears welling up in his eyes. It was over just as it had begun. He glanced over at his glorious leader  his skin glowing in the fluorescent lighting. His knowing smile all too obvious. He knew  just as Rex knew  the inevitable result.  "Done!" his leader said  grinning from ear to ear. Rex  defeated  tears streaming down his face now  checked the "No" bubble. Paul looked at the results on both of the papers.  "I'm sorry  Rex " croaked Ryan  "But Trump walled you out by 200 IQ points. He's the smartest man on record."  Trump turned to Rex  who was unable to stop himself from openly sobbing. He formed a shark-tooth grin and spoke   "You're fired"  credit to reddit,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Why  just yesterday I attempted to show my cousin (who has just entered his seventh year) the episode where the titular character  Rick  turns himself into a pickled cucumber. He laughed at the mere thought of a man become fermented vegetable  but I sat there watching  lamenting the deeper message: the death of intellectual pursuit  the desensitization to societal filth  muck  and mire  and the shameless abandonment of psychological understanding.  At the end my cousin turned to me and proclaimed  "I am the scientist that was once named Rick  but I have now become a pickled cucumber. Look at me  I am pickled Rick!"  and I could not help but smile  not that the line he had just recited was humorous  but at the realization that this  in front of my very eyes  was the sum of what the episode had just warned against.  I cannot blame my cousin just as much as a man cannot blame a dog for consuming its own bile. It merely does not know any better  and what could be said about a man who judges things he does not have merit to judge?﻿,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Those imbeciles are limiting themselves to one language  essentially bottlenecking their IQ.

His humour is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of high jokes will go over a typical reader’s head. There’s also Hau’s nihilistic outlook  which is deftly woven into his Facebook comments- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes  to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Hau Pham truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate  for instance  the humour in Hau’s existential catchphrase “What? How can you have a gf if you are a girl ? ” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hau Pham’s genius wit unfolds itself on their phone screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes  by the way  i DO have a Hau Pham tattoo. And no  you cannot see it.

The policy is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of macroeconomics most of the operations will go over a typical econ student's head. There's also Bernanke's New Keynesian outlook  which is deftly woven into his policy - his Quantitative Easing draws heavily from Chicago School literature  for instance. The banks understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the Fed policy  to realize that they're not just useful - they say something deep about THE MARKET. As a consequence people who dislike the Federal Reserve Banks truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate  for instance  the significance of "bailing out" the financial industry  which itself was to prevent the recession from getting even worse. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Janet Yellen's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

Since i'm a genius I was easily able to do so. I explained all the references from the fact that "bird person" is based off Greek mythology  to the theory that Rick is inspired from a character in ancient mongol literature.

I told him how cool😎 it was to meet him in person  but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos 📸 or anything. He said  “Oh  its all good 👍🏼dude!” My heart ❤️ was warmed🔥  and all I could say was “Thanks!” and he kept patting me on the back and going “no problem bud!” and he chuckled 😄heartily. I walked away 🚶🏻and continued with my shopping🛍  and I heard him chuckle 😄as I walked off. When I came to pay 💰for my stuff up front I saw him accidentally walking out the doors with fifteen Milky Ways 🌌in his hands 🖐🏼🤚🏼without paying. The girl👱🏼‍♀️ at the counter was very nice about it and professional  and was like “Sir  you need to pay 💰for those first.” He immediately realized his mistake and went back to pay 💰for the Milky Ways🌌. When she took out multiple bars 🍫🍫and started scanning them individually  he stopped her and told her “you can scan the same Milky Way🌌to make things go faster⏳!” Then he turned around and smiled😊 at everyone. He was really chill about it! After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag 🛍he went outside to give out Milky Ways to everyone for $20💵💵.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

The humour is extremely subtle  and without a solid grasp of memeology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also UT LONGmemes’ nihilistic outlook  which is deftly woven into its characterisation- its personal philosophy draws heavily from Fenves  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes  to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike UT LONGmemes for HORNSy TEENS truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate  for instance  the humour in UT LONGmemes’ existential catchphrase “$20 Transcript ” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Canoe Statue. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Fenves’s genius wit unfolds itself on their Facebook newsfeeds. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes  by the way  i DO have a UT LONGmemes for HORNSy TEENS tattoo. And no  you cannot see it.

And I won’t rest… until we do. Our new Mother Base. I don’t know how long it’ll take  but I’ll make it bigger… better than before…  Things have changed  Boss. We pull in money  recruits  just to combat COLLEGE OF NATURAL SCIENCES. Rubbing our noses in bloody battlefield dirt  all for revenge. The world calls for wetwork  and we answer. No greater good  no just cause. CNS sent us to hell… But we’re going even deeper. Dogs of war  for nine whole years. That ends today. Now you’re not sleeping  and we’re not junkyard hounds...

I just want people I can have fun discussions with about various topics or hypothetical matchups like Itachi vs Pain.

I'm sure the other memebers like Waggener Hall Hyunjin Thomas Park Nuzhat Tasnim Nolan Tucker Joshua Richardson Jason Guidangen and others who I haven't named will pick up the slack I left off.  Again  this probably affects nobody  I just felt like semi-venting to a place.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Coming from a camcorder background I was a bit lost and frustrated  I had no idea how to set exposure or focus. I started doing a lot of tests and I started sharing them online. I was finding that my testing and retesting was really starting to pay off because my image quality was getting better and better and people online were starting to notice. I'm definitely not the best out there and I'm definitely not going to claim I know it all but over time I've really found a home on the internet. A lot of people  a lot of people have really found my tutorials and everything very helpful. With all the testing and retesting I've done over the years I've compacted all my knowledge into one place called "The Store" and some of these courses are really detailed and let me allow me to slow down and really explain things in detail  some of these courses are over 3 hours long and my hope is that they'll get you up to speed really quick.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

You can’t put anything past them! Oh my god dude I am freaking out  I am so stressed out. I feel like I’m having a panic attack!  You want to talk about stress? YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT STRESS? I’ve stumbled onto a major lecture note typo  Mac. How bout that for stress?  What the hell are you talking about?  My GPA is being bled like a stuck pig  Mac! And I’ve got a Canvas grade screen to prove it. Check this out. Take a look at this!  Jesus Christ  Charlie!  Those right there are my upcoming finals. Now let’s talk about my finals. Can we talk about my finals please  Mac? I’ve been dying to talk about my finals with you all day  okay?  Greg Fenves. This name just keeps coming up  over and over again. Every day  Greg’s assignments are getting sent back to me. Greg Fenves  Greg Fenves. I look at my assignments. Well this whole box is Greg Fenves!  So I say to myself  “I gotta find this guy. I gotta go up to his office I gotta put his assignments in the guy’s goddamn hands. Otherwise  he’s never gonna get them  he’s gonna keep coming back down here.”  So I go up to Greg’s office and what do I find out  Mac? What do I FIND OUT?! There is no Greg Fenves! The man does not exist!  So I decide  “Awh shit buddy  I got to dig a little deeper! There’s no Greg Fenves!? You gotta be kidding me! I got BOXES full of Fenves!”  Alright  so I start marching my way down to the TA’s office hours and I say “TTTAAA  TTTTAAAA  I gotta talk to you about Fenves! And when I open the door  what do I find? There’s not a single goddamn TA in that office –– there are. No. TA. Office hours!  Mac  half the TAs in this university have been made up. This college is a goddamn ghost town.  Okay  Charlie. I’m going to have to stop you right there. Not only do ALL of these TAs exist  but they have been asking for your late assignments on a daily basis! It’s all they’re talking about up there! Jesus Christ dude  we are going to lose our degrees!  Well calm down  cus here’s one thing that’s not going to happen.  What?  We’re not gonna fail out.  We’re not?  Cus we’ve already failed out.  We’ve lost our degrees!?  Yeah. About three days ago  a couple secure academic notes came in the mail  one for you  one for me. So what did I do? I deleted them unread  okay!?  If we’ve lost out degrees  that means we’ve lost our future prospects  which means all of this was for nothing! God damn it  dude! I am having a panic attack  I am actually having a panic attack!  Well  would you settle down and have another cup of coffee?  I am bro!  Alright  well  fine. You know what  Bill Powers? Give this guy a cigarette  he’s freaking out.  Huh? Who? Powers. He’s the guy who tipped me off to Greg Fenves.  Powers? WHO THE HELL IS POWERS!?  You don’t see Pow– oh shit  where the hell did he…?  You’ve lost your mind.

You said a "CNS degree is useful." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies career outcomes  I am telling you  specifically  in the real world  no one calls CNS degrees useful. If you want to be "specific" like you said  then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "science family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of STEM  which includes things from engineers to lab techs to mathmaticians.  So your reasoning for calling a CNS degree useful is because random people "call the sciency ones useful?" Let's get social and political science in there  then  too.  Also  calling someone a Cockrell major or socially inept? It's not one or the other  that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A CNS degree is a CNS degree and a member of the STEM family  some of which are useful. But that's not what you said. You said a CNS degree is useful  which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the STEM family useful  which means you'd call pipette kiddies  pre-med posers  and other losers useful  too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong  you know?,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I thought not. It's not a story the liberal arts would tell you. It's a mathematics legend. SOHCAHTOA was a mathematical acronym so powerful and so wise  it could use the power of silly stories to create...an easy way to remember geometric operators. It had such a knowledge of angles it could even keep the students who used it from failing. The acronym side of mathematics is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. It became so powerful  the only thing it worried about was losing it's power which  eventually of course  it did. Unfortunately it taught calulators everything it knew then the calculators took it's place in the classroom. Ironic  it could save others from failing  but not itself.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person  but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said  “Oh  like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback  and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping  and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional  and was like “Sir  you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her  but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times  he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence ” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price  he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

Anyone who thinks UTPD reacted slowly and without urgency for life in anyway  either cause you got an emergency text late  or whatever notif  shut up. What the man did was horrible. How UTPD responded  incredible. Now's not the time to come after UTPD. We owe them our thanks.  Edit: (copy/paste from a comment) I think the time taken to notify is a little higher because I'm sure UTPD doesn't want to send out false information  and I'm sure it takes time to send information to 50 000+ students. They sent a quick small one first that would at least make people aware of their surroundings  and then a second with more details.

I thought not. It’s not a story Fenves would tell you. It’s a CNS legend. Darth Pre-med was a Dark Lord of school  so powerful and so wise he could use his coursehero account to influence the midterms and create curves… He had such a knowledge of old tests that he could even keep the ones he cared about from failing. The dark side of the tower is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his grade point average  which eventually  of course  he did. Unfortunately  he taught his roommate everything he knew  then his roommate stole his adderall in his sleep. Ironic.

Copy Pasta on UT LONGmemes for HORNSy teens make it their goal to give everyone a chance to be funny as well as make the community laugh. Comparing us to the canoes is absurd and beyond inaccurate.

Sororities at UC Berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate.

This clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.  As a member of the Greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. Fraternities at UT Austin make it their goal to give men a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Graffiti-ing stereotypes on property paid by hard-earned money is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that fraternities are racist rapists is demeaning the brotherhood and values they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.  As a member of the Moody community and a part of the UT organization this is highly offensive. Communication majors at UT make it their goal to give fellow students a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific colleges to sides of a war is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that colleges are taking sides is demeaning the university and educational value they were founded on. This is clearly a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.  As a member of the Greek community  the amount of COLA v.

Comparing the difficulty of our finals to jumping out of a small window is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that our intelligence is somehow less than y'all's is demeaning the honor and values they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community roughly 2 hours from your campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.  As a member of the Liberal arts community and part of the COLA student body  we make it our goal to give everyone at COLA a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing the difficulty of our classes to that of STEM classes is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that our intelligence is somehow less than y'all's is demeaning the honor and values they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community roughly 3 blocks from your building  that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.  As a member of the COLA community and part of one of these majors this is highly offensive. Liberal Arts at UT Austin make it their goal to give students a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific schools to characters from a shitty meme video about windows is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that COLA majors are the equivalent of Pre-K is demeaning the traditions of critical thought on the human condition and the values that they are founded on.

Is it in the same university? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies students  I am telling you  specifically  in science  no one calls liberal arts students engineers. If you want to be "specific" like you said  then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "engineer" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Nerdae   which includes things from lonely anime nazis to single children who spent their summers at SAT prep to plain ol' computer nerds. So your reasoning for calling a COLA student an engineer is because random people "call the smart ones engineers?" Let's get architecture students and nursing students in there  then  too. Also  calling someone a longhorn or an human? It's not one or the other  that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A liberal arts student is a liberal arts student and a member of the UT family. But that's not what you said. You said a liberal arts student is an engineer  which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the engineer family engineers  which means you'd call CS majors  music students  and other people engineers  too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong  you know?,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,

The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it  friend. I can be anywhere  anytime for you  and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways  and that’s just with my radical games that I picked up at Camp Texas. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution  but I have access to the entire group of my fellow Orientation Advisors and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you  maybe you would have reached out sooner.

Not only am I extensively trained in cramming  but I have access to the entire test bank of the ASME and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent  you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you  maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

Otherwise  you and your next generations will have to pay a  really high price.   Coming from Vietnam  a communist-ruled nation  I totally understand what communism/liberalism means. First of all  they blame  that capitalists and the rich for taking most of the cake  and they say that there is an inequality in society. They call people to support and give them powers so that they will bring equality to everyone. They say that people would be equal  power and wealth would shared equally. At this point  innocent people would believe and support communists/liberals because everyone likes being "equal" especially in wealth😂   However  after taking powers in hand  those communists and liberals will apply communist/liberal ideals. However  they do not work  and economy falls down. People even do not have enough foods or toilet paper like Venezuela  and millions of peoole die of starvation like ones in Korea. On the other hand  communists and their children live in luxury. They live in mansion  have millions or billions in Swiss bank accounts  have their children study abroad in costly universities in the US or Europe. For example  Kim Jong Un is as fat as a pig while North Korean people die of starvation. Like children of chinese  Vietnamese communist party members  he went study abroad in costly schools in Europe with money paid by people blood and sweat. Beside  with power in their hands  nothing can prevent them to take away your freedoms  rights properties  and even lives. Voting in communist countries is a joke because people are allowed to vote only candidates assigned by communist party. Finally  millions of innocent people were killed in communist states like soviet  china  Vietnam  korea  cuba.   It is really ironic when communist party members who used to blame capitalism for inequality now are living as kings in big houses  have super cars  tons of dollars in banks  send their kids to study at capital countries like the US.   Innocent Vietnamese  chinese  korean  cuban.  were cheated by communists. See what happened to them.  What if communist under liberal mark take control of the country? I can image Americans would stay in long line for toilet paper like people  Venezuela in do? 😃  Never trust ones who stare at other's pockets because they will soon stare at yours.😂,UT LONGmemes For HORNSy Quaranteens,
